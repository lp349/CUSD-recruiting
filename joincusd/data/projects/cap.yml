tagline: Helping Cornell achieve carbon neutrality by 2035.
description:
  "<p class=\"lede\">Members of the Climate Action Plan project work closely with the Cornell Facilities department and Cornell's Campus Sustainability Office to help advance the university-wide action plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. Focusing on particular actions from the plan, each team has the unique opportunity to see the value of their work has right on campus.</p>
  <p>Past CAP teams have done a feasibility study on the placement of a wind turbine on campus property and researched ways to make the currently existing on-campus hydropower plant more modern and efficient, as well as looking into innovative ways to educate the public on alternative energy.</p>
  <p>Currently, the CAP project is in a scoping phase as we determine the next major initiative to pursue. There are, however, a very limited number of spots on the team available to highly-autonomous students with demonstrated ability in project management who wish to take on an independent project within CAP.</p>
  <p>Moving forward, CAP aims to continue making an impact by taking on and helping to accomplish other actions from Cornell's climate action plan.</p>
